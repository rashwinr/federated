  For ease of reasoning about and proving completeness of TFF-to-TF

  Any block of TFF reducible to TensorFlow must have a functional type
  signature without nested functions, and therefore we may assume there is
  a single Reference in the code we are parsing to TF. We continually push logic
  into the compiled computation as we make our way up the AST, preserving the
  pattern above; when we hit the lambda that binds this reference, we simply
  unwrap the call.

  To perform this process, we must begin with this pattern; otherwise there
  may be some arbitrary TFF constructs present between any occurrences of TF
  and the arguments to which they are applied, e.g. arbitrary selections from
  and nesting of tuples containing references.

  `insert_called_tf_identity_at_leaves` ensures that the pattern above is
  present at the leaves of any portion of the TFF AST which is destined to be
  compiled into TensorFlow; that is, any `building_blocks.Reference` whose type
  is compatible with stamping into a TensorFlow graph.

    comp: Instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` whose AST we
      will traverse, replacing appropriate instances of
      `building_blocks.Reference` with graphs representing the identity function

      a parameter and result type which are both able to be stamped in to a
